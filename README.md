I am continually learning and striving to transition from a manual tester to an automation engineer. With over 14 years of experience in manual testing, Iâ€™ve faced increasing challenges in finding work in Poland since 2023, as manual testers are often undervalued. Despite searching for over a year, I remain determined to upskill and build a career in automation testing. This repository is a significant milestone in my journey, showcasing my progress and dedication to mastering automation frameworks.
